# Cricket Dashboard

## Project Overview
Cricket Dashboard is an end-to-end cricket data analytics project that involves web scraping, data preprocessing, and data visualization. In this project, we scrape data from the ESPN Cricinfo website, process it using Python and Pandas, and then visualize the insights using Power BI. The project focuses on T20 World Cup cricket data and utilizes Bright Data for web scraping.

## Project Structure 
- t20_json_files/: Directory containing raw JSON files scraped from ESPN Cricinfo.
- t20_csv_files/: Directory where the processed CSV files will be stored.
- data_preprocessing.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing.
- PowerBI/: Directory containing Power BI files for data visualization.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing involves reading JSON files, transforming the data into Pandas DataFrames, cleaning the data, and saving the processed data as CSV files. Additonally, we also process individual data for batting and bowling players.

## Data Visualization
- Web Scraping: Bright Data
- Data Processing: Python, Pandas
- Visualization: Power BI
